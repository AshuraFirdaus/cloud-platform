# Git Workflow

This repository follows a simple enterprise-style Git workflow:

- `main` branch represents the production environment
- `dev` branch is used for active development and testing
- All changes are developed in `dev` and merged into `main` via Pull Request

This approach ensures stability, traceability, and safer deployments.

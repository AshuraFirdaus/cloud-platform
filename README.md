# Cloud Platform (Production Simulation)

This repository simulates a production-ready cloud platform inspired by enterprise practices.

## Objective
- Demonstrate cloud engineering capabilities in AWS
- Implement secure CI/CD with Jenkins
- Provision infrastructure using Terraform (IaC)
- Apply security, observability, and operational best practices
- Simulate real production workflows, incident handling, and team collaboration

## Scope
- AWS Infrastructure (VPC, EC2, ALB, IAM)
- CI/CD using Jenkins (CloudBees-style)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Security integration (SonarQube, SSO)
- Operational readiness (monitoring, incident, postmortem)

## Environment
- Dev
- Prod (simulated)

> This project is designed to reflect how a cloud platform is operated in a real enterprise environment, not just as a lab or proof of concept.
